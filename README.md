# Heart-Disease-Prediction

I explored a heart disease dataset obtained from kaggle.com. I carried out exploratory data analysis and I implemented machine learning algorithms such as K-NearestNeighbors, RandomForestClassifier and LogisticRegression and selected the best algorithm with a high accuracy which i used in prediction of Heart disease.
